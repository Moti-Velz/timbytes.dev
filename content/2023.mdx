I created this blog during holidays and wanted to share a couple random thoughts.

**Disclaimer:** This is a **work in progress**. I  play with different technologies and try new patterns here. Then maybe I'll have something interesting to write about.

## Content Management

I've always thought markdown files needed some love. I've seen how CMSs can make content management easier, but I've been wanting to create a proper portfolio website, and I took the opportunity to dabble a bit with NextJS.

## What to Expect

I already have a couple of ideas for posts, you can expect to see some of them in the next couple of weeks. I'm also planning to write about some of the things I've been working on lately. If you have some ideas or suggestions, feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tim_bytes).
